# angular2-webpack-ngmodule
Angular2, Webpack and Live NgModule example

## Why?
* I like the [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) approach to generate components and tests  
* I like how [webpack](webpack.github.io) allows one to customize the deployment of the Angular [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) framework
* While Google is still working on the [webpack addon](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/1656#issuecomment-239366723)  
```
  Sorry but we will not expose the webpack confit for various reasons. 
  An addon system is being designed that would allow such a thing but for the time being we won't expose it.
```

## While waiting:  

I read the documentation and tried to come up with an in-between example allowing me to make both tech working together

https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/webpack.html
https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/ngmodule.html

## the project demonstrates one version of Google's LIVE example

https://angular.io/resources/live-examples/ngmodule/ts/pre-shared.3.eplnkr.html

## How to:

* clone the project
* install the modules
```

```
